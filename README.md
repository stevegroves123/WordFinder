I want to start by thanking Paul Hudson @twostraws; www.hackingwithswift.com for all his excellent tutorials, his continual hard work on making something as complex as creating an iPhone app seem so simple.
Without Paul's work this old engineer would never be able to create the madness.


This is one of those find-aword-within-another-word sort of games.
The object is to find as many three letter, four letter or five letter words within an eight letter word.

You have 120 seconds to find as many words as you can, the app uses Apple's dictionary built into the iPhone / iPad so expect Americam spellings, names, and some very weird words.

The score is a sum of all the letters used, so the longer words score more; although lots of three letter words also gives you a good score.

There are three high scores, one for each of the "skill levels" (3 letter, 4 letter and 5 letter)

You can't change the skill level once you have typed a word into the game, so choose which level you start with carefully.
